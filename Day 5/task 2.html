        <h1> ABOUT RAINBOW</h1>
        <p>&emsp;&emsp; When sunlight hits a rain droplet, some of the light is reflected. The electromagnetic spectrum is made of light with many different wavelengths, and each is reflected at a different angle. Thus, spectrum is separated, producing a rainbow. </p>
