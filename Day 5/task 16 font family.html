An example of this range of meanings is that the love of a mother differs from the love of a spouse, which differs from the love for food. Most commonly, love refers to a feeling of a strong attraction and emotional attachment.Love is considered to be both positive and negative.</p>
        <p> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;It's most often understood as an intense feeling of deep affection. Biblically, love has a much deeper and richer meaning; it transcends a feeling or emotion. This is what we see in 1 Corinthians 13. Paul tells us that love isn't merely a feeling but a way of relating to others.</p>
